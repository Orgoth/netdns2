- changed the Net_DNS2::sock array to use the SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_STREAM defines, rather than

  the strings 'tcp' or 'udp'.

- fixed a bug in the Net_DNS2_Header and Net_DNS2_Question classes, where I was using the wrong
  bit-shift operators when parsing some of the values.

  This only became apparent when somebody was trying to use the CAA class (id 257); it was causing
  this to roll over to the next 8 bit value, and returning 1 (RR A) instead of the CAA class.

- fixed a bug that occurs when a DNS lookup request times out, and then the same class is reused
  for a subsequent request. Because I'm caching the sockets, the timed out data could eventually
  come in, and end up being seen as the result for a subsequent lookup.

  this obviously fails as the request id's don't match, so it throws all sorts of errors.

  there isn't a good way to "reset" a socket to ensure no future data will come on it, so instead,
  I'm simply closing an un-setting any socket that receives an error. This will stop a failed request
  from affected the next request.

  there is a net Net_DNS2::generateError() function called in any error condition, that cleans up
  the socket, and then throws an error.
